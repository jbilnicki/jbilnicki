- 👋 Hi, I’m Jakub
- 👀 I’m interested in physiology of the dopamine system in mammals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning openCV in python, and I'm working on a module: Bongo 'Bongo Offers Neuroscientific Graphs and Outputs' implementing openCV, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and more to analyze voltammetric data, track animal in open field and check if electrode I used during experiment was really in that structure I wanted it to be...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to analysis of data from behavioural as well as voltammetric experiments,
- I am also open to learning new things and work on some other neuroscientific/biological projects
- 📫 How to reach me: via GitHub
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I appreciate culture of Japan, and currently I am learning Japanese a bit
